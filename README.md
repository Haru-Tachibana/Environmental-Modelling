**Objectives:**
1) Simulate global average temperature for the future, up to the end of the century, for two different scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.

2) Explore what effect model choices can have on the simulated results, namely changing the number of layers that are used in the model to represent the ocean.

3) Simulate the effect of volcanic eruptions on the climate, separately for large volcanic eruptions such as those seen in recent centuries, and for a super-volcano eruption like what happened 74,000 years ago.

### Part 1: 
Every model need input data. We will use two different emissions scenarios as input datasets for our two respective simulations.
1. **SSP5-8.5** - has **high greenhouse gas emissions** in the future (a typical world without climate action, i.e., limited/ no climate policy to reduce global emissions of GHGs)
2. **SSP1-1.9** - has **low GHGs emissions**, a future world with **strong climate action**, in line with the 2015 United Nations Paris Agreement.\
<br>
We will run the two scenarios separately and after we have done the simulations we will compare them.
