**Objectives:**
1) Simulate global average temperature for the future, up to the end of the century, for two different scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.

2) Explore what effect model choices can have on the simulated results, namely changing the number of layers that are used in the model to represent the ocean.

3) Simulate the effect of volcanic eruptions on the climate, separately for large volcanic eruptions such as those seen in recent centuries, and for a super-volcano eruption like what happened 74,000 years ago.
